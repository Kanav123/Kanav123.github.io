Hi, I am a PhD Candidate at the University of Waterloo supervised by Prof. [David Clausi](https://uwaterloo.ca/systems-design-engineering/profile/dclausi) and Prof. [John Zelek](https://uwaterloo.ca/systems-design-engineering/profile/jzelek).I am currently working on computer vision based sports analytics. I am interested in the problems of event detection, tracking and pose estimation with their applications in team sports such as hockey and soccer. [Here](https://kanav123.github.io/files/cv.pdf) is a link to my CV.
